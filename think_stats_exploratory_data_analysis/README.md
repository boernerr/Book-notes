Notes from the book: *Think Stats Exploratory data analysis* by Downey

## Chapter 3 Probability Mass Functions  
Mot much detail is given, but PMFs are great way to summarize data distribution. Basically a histogram that is normalized
to the probability of the continuous values occurrence. Need to see how this differs from Probability density function!  

## Chapter 4 Cumulative Distribution Functions  
Remember the CDF is the same as the ECDF (We had a video on this way back on the InTO data science team)! It is really powerful
to use both a histogram in conjunction with a CDF plot! While the histogram can change depending on bin size, 
the ECDF will be constant.
