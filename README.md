## Chapter 4: Clarifying the Measurement problem

### Notes 5/13/2022 1:00 BEGIN

Prior to making a measurement, we need to ask the following questions:
1. What is the decision this measurement supports
2. What is the *definition* of the thing being measured in terms of observable consequences
3. How does this thing matter to the decision being asked
4. How much do you know about this thing now?(what is current lvl of uncertainty)
5. What is the value of additional info

### Getting the language right: what 'uncertainty' and 'risk' really mean

'uncertainty' and 'risk' are distinctly different terms  

"*Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar
notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. ...
The essential fact is that “risk” means in some cases a quantity susceptible

of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this
character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the
bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really
present and operating.*" - Frank Knight

**Uncertainty**: The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. The “true” outcome/state/
result/value is not known.  

**Measurement of Uncertainty**: A set of probabilities assigned to
a set of possibilities. For example: “There is a 60% chance this
market will more than double in five years, a 30% chance it
will grow at a slower rate, and a 10% chance the market will
shrink in the same period.”  

**Risk**: A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve
a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.  

**Measurement of Risk**: A set of possibilities each with quantified
probabilities and quantified losses. For example: “We believe
there is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a
loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs.”

## Chapter 5: Calibrate Estimates: how much you currently know  
### Notes 5/16/2022 12:37 END  
This entire chapter on calibration training. This is the process of being a certain % confident that  
some event will happen. The analogy is given that if we deem there is a 90% chance something will happen in  
a given range, then we should feel equally good about our chances of a game of chance with a 90% chance we  
win a prize. The example given from the book to demonstrate 90% certainty:  
1. You win $1,000 if the true year of publication of Newton’s book turns
out to be between the dates you gave for the upper and lower bound.
If not, you win nothing.
2. You spin a dial divided into two unequal “pie slices,” one comprising
90% of the dial and the other just 10%. If the dial lands on the large
slice, you win $1,000. If it lands on the small slice, you win nothing
(i.e., there is a 90% chance you win $1,000). (See Exhibit 5.2.)
   
## Chapter 6: Measuring Risk thru modeling
### Notes 5/28/2022 14:28 BEGIN
#### Real Risk Analysis: Monte Carlo
Using ranges to represent your uncertainty instead of unrealistically precise
point values clearly has advantages. When you allow yourself to use ranges
and probabilities, you don’t really have to assume anything you don’t know
for a fact.  

In fact, all risk in any project investment ultimately can be expressed
by one method: the ranges of uncertainty on the costs and benefits and
probabilities on events that might affect them. If you know precisely the
amount and timing of every cost and benefit (as is implied by traditional
business cases based on fixed point values), you literally have no risk. There
is no chance that any benefit would be lower or cost would be higher than
you expect. But all we really know about these things is the range, not
exact points. And because we only have broad ranges, there is a chance we
will have a negative return. That is the basis for computing risk, and that is
what the Monte Carlo simulation is for.

## Chapter 7: Measuring the Value of info  
The McNamara Fallacy
The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is
OK as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can’t
easily be measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value.
This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that
what can’t be measured easily isn’t important. This is blindness. The
fourth step is to say that what can’t easily be measured really doesn’t
exist. This is suicide.
—Charles Handy, The Empty Raincoat (1995)—describing
the Vietnam-era measurement policies of Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara  

As mentioned in Chapter 2, there are really only three basic reasons
why information ever has value to a business:
1. Information reduces uncertainty about decisions that have economic
consequences.
2. Information affects the behavior of others, which has economic consequences.
3. Information sometimes has its own market value.  

The value of information regarding its effect on human behavior is
exactly equal to the value of the difference in human behavior.
