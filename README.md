## Chapter 4: Clarifying the Measurement problem

### Notes taken on 5/13/2022 1:00 BEGIN

Prior to making a measurement, we need to ask the following questions:
1. What is the decision this measurement supports
2. What is the *definition* of the thing being measured in terms of observable consequences
3. How does this thing matter to the decision being asked
4. How much do you know about this thing now?(what is current lvl of uncertainty)
5. What is the value of additional info

### Getting the language right: what 'uncertainty' and 'risk' really mean

'uncertainty' and 'risk' are distinctly different terms
"*Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar
notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. ...
The essential fact is that “risk” means in some cases a quantity susceptible

of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this
character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the
bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really
present and operating.*" - Frank Knight

**Uncertainty**: The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. The “true” outcome/state/
result/value is not known.
**Measurement of Uncertainty**: A set of probabilities assigned to
a set of possibilities. For example: “There is a 60% chance this
market will more than double in five years, a 30% chance it
will grow at a slower rate, and a 10% chance the market will
shrink in the same period.”
**Risk**: A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve
a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.
**Measurement of Risk**: A set of possibilities each with quantified
probabilities and quantified losses. For example: “We believe
there is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a
loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs.”
